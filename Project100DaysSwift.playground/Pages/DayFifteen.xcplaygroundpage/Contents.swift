/*
 Public: this means everyone can read and write the property.
 Internal: this means only your Swift code can read and write the property. If you ship your code as a framework for others to use, they wonâ€™t be able to read the property.
 File Private: this means that only Swift code in the same file as the type can read and write the property.
 Private: this is the most restrictive option, and means the property is available only inside methods that belong to the type, or its extensions.
